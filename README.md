# C-Sharp-OOP-lessons
Repository to store the lessons I've made to learn C# OOP structure in a simple way.

Most of these activities will be consoled based. This repository is meant to teach OOP in a simple way, with all the concepts within it. It might receive updates or not in a future. It is highly recommended to have guidance while doing the activities.

> The solutions have been executed with VSCode using .NET 8. I will not answer questions about the code or programs themselves, please contact a teacher or research online.
